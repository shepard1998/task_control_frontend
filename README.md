# Task Control

Frontend part of the technical test exercise. The user is able to add new tasks, which will be stored in a database. Requests are handled by the backend with Spring Boot.

## Clarifications
-The delete or edit functionalities were not implemented because the exercise did not ask for them and I understood that they were not being evaluated.

-The tasks-page.service.ts file contains the link to which the project makes the requests. If the backend uses another configuration or port, please modify it.

## Bugs
You cannot modify text already transformed into a tag, only delete it.
