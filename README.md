# Task Control

Frontend part of the technical test exercise. The user is able to add new tasks, which will be stored in a database. Requests are handled by the backend with Spring Boot.

## Clarifications

The delete or edit functionalities were not implemented because the exercise did not ask for them and I understood that they were not being evaluated.

## Bugs
You cannot modify text already transformed into a tag, only delete it.
